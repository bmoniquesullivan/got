                <p>The only world we care about on the Seven Kingdoms is Westeros</p>
                <p>The story takes place primarily on an elongated continent called Westeros, which is roughly the size of South America. The continent is home to the Seven Kingdoms, also known as "the Realm" or the "Sunset Kingdom", located to the south side of the Wall, a massive man-made ice wall (allegedly fused with magic) 700 feet in height and spanning east–west for 300 miles from coast to coast. The Seven Kingdoms are further divided into the so-called "North" and "South" by a swamp-rich isthmus called the Neck. The land north of the Wall still makes up a large chunk (being roughly the size of Canada) of Westeros, but remains largely unmapped and unexplored, especially the ice field region north and west of a massive mountain range called the Frostfangs, which marks the farthest geographic limit of human settlements. The northern extent of the continent is therefore unknown, although thought to be continuous with a polar ice cap north of the Shivering Sea known as the White Waste.</p>
                <p>The Kingdoms are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Kingdom of the North, ruled by House Stark of Winterfell</li>
                    <li>The Kingdom of the Isles and the Rivers, ruled by House Hoare of Harrenhal</li>
                    <li>The Kingdom of Mountain and Vale, ruled by House Arryn of The Eyrie</li>
                    <li>The Kingdom of the Rock, ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock</li>
                    <li>The Kingdom of the Storm, ruled by House Durrandon of Storm's End</li>
                    <li>The Kingdom of the Reach, ruled by House Gardener of Highgarden</li>
                    <li>The Principality of Dorne, ruled by House Martell of Sunspear.</li>
                </ul>
